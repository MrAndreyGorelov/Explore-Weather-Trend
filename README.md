# Explore-Weather-Trend

# Overall Details 

As it is the first project of the program, it was easy to get started with. 

The needed steps to be taken were
- **Download the Data**
- **Open the Excel Files**
- **Open the Excel Files with Python**
- **Express the Findings**

# No Python File

The python code was run on the Udacity website, there I did not use Jupyter, hence dont have a downloaded code.

My findinds are illustrated in the excel document (the graphs on the right)
